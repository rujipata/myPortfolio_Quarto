# Canvas

## Canvas and MyOpenMath

<!---Spearheaded the integration of MyOpenMath—a free, open-source online mathematics learning platform developed by the WAMAP Consortium—with Canvas LMS to enhance student accessibility and reduce course material costs. Successfully implemented a seamless single sign-on experience that allowed students to complete assignments directly through Canvas while maintaining automatic grade synchronization. This initiative eliminated textbook expenses while providing students with a robust platform for mathematics practice and assessment. Source: Claude

## Canvas and Microsoft OneNote

- I used Microsof OneNote mainly for:
    - Presenting class materials; 
    - Organizing lecture notes for students and recitation leaders;
    - Sharing students'written-work assignments;
    - Providing comments on students'assignments submitted via OneNote.

# Quarto

- This portfolio is developed by [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) that is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. With the basic knowledge of `Git`, this portfolio is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) at no cost.
- This portfolio is a part of my showcases demonstrating my proficiency in using Quarto, a cutting-edge publishing system that enables instructors to create dynamic, interactive learning content. Despite being relatively new, Quarto has rapidly gained popularity among educators and scientists due to its versatility in blending narrative text with executable code, supporting multiple programming languages, and producing various output formats, that are engaging, reproducible educational materials that can be easily updated and adapted to different learning contexts.
- Click [HERE](../post-with-code/codingSamples.qmd) to see some examples of executable codes on Quarto.
