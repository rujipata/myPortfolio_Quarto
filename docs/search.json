With the basic knowledge of Git, this portfolio is published on GitHub at no cost.\nThis portfolio is a part of my showcases demonstrating my proficiency in using Quarto, a cutting-edge publishing system that enables instructors to create dynamic, interactive learning content. Despite being relatively new, Quarto has rapidly gained popularity among educators and scientists due to its versatility in blending narrative text with executable code, supporting multiple programming languages, and producing various output formats, that are engaging, reproducible educational materials that can be easily updated and adapted to different learning contexts.\nClick HERE to see some examples of executable codes on Quarto.\n\n\n\n\nCanvas"
